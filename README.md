# Brazillian-E-Commerce Olist Analysys


*By Kristine Petrosyan*

## Problem statement

As a data scientist, I have been tasked with drawing insights from a Kaggle dataset Brazillian retailer Olist. In particular, I will seek to answer the following questions, which are of interest to stakeholders:

1. Customer LTV(lifetime value)
2. Monthly performance of the business
3. Best selling categories
4. Prediction for future sales

## Components

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/kristinepetrosyan/Brazillian-E-Commerce-Analysys/blob/main/olistanalysis.ipynb) is our key deliverable and contains the answers to the above questions.

## Data

The data was provided from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce and https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist.

## Methodology

* The relevant data was queried from the table and stored as a Pandas DataFrame. 
* Data manipulation was undertaken as required (e.g. creating feature columns). 
* EDA and visualisations were created.
* Time Series Arima model were used to forecast the future sales.


## Findings and Recommendations

* As a conclusion we have:
    - From all customers only 3% are recurring and remaining 97% are just below 1 year purchasers.
    - Total revenues across 29 segments came in at 664,858 in the first eight months of 2018. The biggest segment was 'watches', which generated 17.4% of total revenues.
    - The best categories are watches and audio.
    - Though 'watches' segment is the largest part of revenue, it has only two sellers. Furthermore, the leading seller generated 97.0% of segment revenue.
